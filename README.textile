h1. Very Nice Menu

This is a Ruby lib to create a tree of menus. Very nice. Really!

BTW this document is written with a certain portion of humor (insanity).

h2. Features

* Deeply nestable
* You can have menus and entries mixed on every level.

h2. Test

Before your dirty hands touch a single line of code be sure to run the tests by invoking

bc. rspec

Otherwise we'll find and punish you! Promised.

h2. Roadmap - The BIG P I C T U R E

* First versions are about building a valid data structure needed to create menus.
* The data model will be enhanced with information to later support authorization and visibility decisions.
* Internationalization will also be prepared.
* Then the problem of rendering menus will be targeted. This might become a framework specific renderer and thus end up in a separate repository but is surely part of the big picture.
