h1. Very Nice Menu

This is a Ruby lib to create a tree of menus. Very nice. Really!

BTW this document is written with a certain portion of humor (insanity).

h2. Features

* Deeply nestable
* You can have menus and entries mixed on every level.
* Simple role based access control with permission inheritance that can be optionally switched of (see @rbac_spec.rb@ for details.)

h2. Test

Before your dirty hands touch a single line of code be sure to run the tests by invoking

bc. rspec

Otherwise we'll find and punish you! Promised.

h2. Roadmap - The BIG P I C T U R E

* First versions are about building a valid data structure needed to create menus.
* The data model will be enhanced with information to later support authorization and visibility decisions.
* Internationalization will also be prepared.
* Then the problem of rendering menus will be targeted. This might become a framework specific renderer and thus end up in a separate repository but is surely part of the big picture.

h2. Usage

bc.
	menu = VeryNiceMenu.build('Main Menu', :allowed_for => [:admin])    
	menu.submenu("Main Menu - Submenu 1") do |submenu|        
		submenu.entry("My Entry")
	end
	
	submenu = menu.submenus.first
  entry   = submenu.entries.first

  menu.allowed_for?(:admin)
  => true
  menu.allowed_for?(:everyone)
  => false

  submenu.allowed_for?(:admin)
  => true
  submenu.allowed_for?(:everyone)
  => false

  entry.allowed_for?(:admin)
  => true

  entry.allowed_for?(:everyone)
  => false
